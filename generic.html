									<h3 class="major">Phishing</h3>
									<p>Using specially crafted email messages to induce a recipient into divulging personal or financial information is the basis of a phishing attack – and hackers have improved on the technique by using social engineering to add an element of increased urgency into their lures.</p>

									<p>A not-to-be-missed financial deal or software download. A court summons from the power company, over that unpaid bill. An alert from the police, regarding your recent browsing activity. Any or all of these can be the bait that lures you to a spoofed website where an online form harvests your credentials, or malware is pushed onto your system in a “drive-by download.”</p>

									<h3 class="major">Cookie Theft</h3>
									<p>The cookies (little text files) stored in your system or browser cache when you visit various websites can hold a wealth of information about you – including personal and financial data, user credentials, and passwords.</p>
									
								 <p>Cookies may be stored as plain text, or with varying degrees of encryption (depending on the website). And the use of browser add-ons has made the decades-old practice of cookie theft a richer and easier prospect for hackers.</p>
								 
								 <h3 class="major">Denial of Service/Distributed Denial of Service (DoS/DDoS)</h3>
									<p>A classic technique used to bring down systems or networks, by overloading them with login attempts, data requests, repetitive tasks, etc.</p>
									
								 <p>Attacks range from the fairly basic (configuring a system to continually bombard a site or server with requests), to the orchestrated (infecting a multitude of systems with malware to form a “botnet” that proceeds to flood a target network with unmanageable traffic), to the specific and sophisticated (buffer overflow attacks which allow hackers to gain access to personal information by filling online form fields with excess data, so they freeze up).</p>
								 
								 <h3 class="major">Man in the Middle</h3>
									<p>Unsecured network connections expose users to this particular tactic, which involves intercepting the data stream between sender and recipient (of an ongoing communication or file transfer). An attacker effectively establishes two connections: One between themselves and a server/sender, and another between themselves and the client/recipient. They can then read or modify the data being passed through their proxy connection.</p>
									
									<p>The objective may be to observe and record a confidential transmission such as an exchange of login credentials or the transfer of intellectual property. Or the attacker may insert malicious code into the data stream, compromising or infecting either or both systems involved in the exchange. If undetected, such attacks may persist for an extended time period.</p>
									
									<h3 class="major">Malware</h3>
									<p>One of the greatest weapons in the hacker’s arsenal is malicious software of all kinds. Viruses, Trojans (innocent-looking files and programs that deliver a malicious payload later on), worms (for continuous network infiltration), and ransomware can all deliver a handsome pay-day – if you allow them onto your system.</p>
									
									<h3 class="major">Keylogger</h3>
									<p>One of the simplest and oldest hacking techniques, keylogging allows attackers with basic software to record to a log file the strokes you make on a keyboard (or in more sophisticated cases, the clicks and movements of a mouse). These log files may hold sensitive data like passwords and user names.</p>
									
									<h3 class="major">Watering Hole and WAP Attacks</h3>
									<p>Setting up a fake wireless access point or WAP (like a spoofed WiFi hotspot) is a great way for hackers to gain a captive audience whose data streams can be monitored, intercepted, or hijacked for various purposes.</p>
									
									<p>Likewise, setting up a bogus but attractive website (like a spoofed social media platform) in a “watering hole” attack is a great way to assemble a herd of unwitting victims in one place – where you can harvest data, or spread a malware infection to the maximum number of recipients.</p>
